<p>Solving Bee is a tool to help you with the Spelling Bee word puzzle. To use it, simply press the "Scan" button and aim your camera at a puzzle, either from the print or online versions.</p>

<p>Once a puzzle has been scanned, you will be shown the words that can be spelled using the letters from the puzzle, applying the print (5 letters or more) or digital (4 letters or more) rules as appropriate. To make things more fun, instead of getting the words directly, you're shown their definitions, as a hint before revealing the answer.</p>
